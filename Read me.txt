This is the algorithm used in the paper 'Perturbative study of the one dimensional quantum clock model'.
It calculates the ground states energy series E(G_ns) of a chain with length ns to any order.
The algorithm has two parts: 
(1)'States generation.nb' is a mathematica notebook that generates all states to be used in the second 
part. The input parameters are 'ns','ord','maxupdis','maxdndis', whose descriptions are in the notebook.
The results will be written into three text files.
(2)'Series calculation.f95' is a Fortran algorithm that read the three text files generated by 'States
 generation.nb', and calculate the series E(G_ns). 
The ground state energy density of an infinite chain to order 2k can be expressed as E(G_k)-E(G_(k-1)).
One should put both files in the same folder before running them.
